Kitsune-enabled Redis
=====================

This is a version of the Redis key-value store patched to support dynamic
updating using Kitsune.

The 'redis' directory contains versions of Redis changed minimally,
only to enable dynamic updating. The 'redis-noref' directory is
additionally patched to enable constant-time dynamic updates.

Building
========

To build all versions, run `make` in either the 'redis' or
'redis-noref' directories. To build a specific version, run `make` in
any of the redis version subdirectories of redis or redis-noref.

If Kitsune is not installed in your PATH, the environment variable
KITSUNE_PATH must refer to a valid Kitsune installation (the `bin`
directory of the core Kitsune repository will work).

The build process will produce a shared object, `redis.so`, in each
version's subdirectory.

Running
=======

Use the Kitsune driver utility to run the Redis shared object as such:

`driver redis.so redis.conf`

Updating
========

To update Redis, use Kitsune's `doupd` script:

`doupd <redis pid> <new tor version.so>`

For a dynamic update to work, the target version must have been built
with the running version specified as its previous version. All
versions of redis are, by default, built to update from the last
Available version.
